# DINO ON WHEELS - ASSEMBLY GAME

## Introduction

This project was developed by me in the 2nd semester of college for the COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE course taught by Professor EDUARDO BRAULIO. The game is a fun and educational project featuring a character named DINO, who rides a skateboard on the road. The main objective of the game is to avoid the constantly moving obstacles.
